This is a Python script for Photoshop that takes the current image, creates a duplicate layer, brightens the image by 10%, and applies a layer mask to the duplicated image:



# Get the current document
doc = ps.app.activeDocument

# Create a duplicate layer
dup_layer = doc.activeLayer.duplicate()

# Brighten the image by 10%
adjustment_layer = ps.LayerAdjustment(BrightnessContrast(brightness=10))
dup_layer.adjustments.add(adjustment_layer)

# Apply a layer mask to the duplicated layer
layer_mask = dup_layer.createLayerMask(ps.MaskToSelection)
